# Transfer-Learning-in-Neural-Network

# Getting Started
We will go through implement pretrained network in this repo. The pretrained network is implemented using pytorch. This readme file will you install the dependencies locally. 

# Dependencies
To use this notebook you can clone this repo using git clone https://github.com/JauraSeerat/Transfer-Learning-in-Neural-Networks.git

These notebooks require PyTorch and torchvision. I would recommend to go through the instruction shared by Source [PyTorch documentation ...](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/). Choose the stable version, appropiarte OS and python version, which you would like to install.

It is always best if work through Anaconda environment. Anaconda is the recommended package manger, it will provide you all the PyTorch dependencies. The  Source [PyTorch documentation ...](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) have shared all the details in terms of the prerequisite to install PyTorch on your local machine.

Please follow the Source [Anaconda documentation...](https://www.anaconda.com/) to install anaconda correctly according to your machine requirements. 

Final requirement is GPU to accelerate network computatons. PyTorch use library CUDA to accelerate GPU operations. If you does not have GPU, please use cloud services like google colab, AWS to train your network on GPU.
